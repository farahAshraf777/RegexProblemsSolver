Java Regular Expressions Problems Solver

This repository contains a Java application designed to solve a series of problems using regular expressions. The application reads input values from a text file, processes them to solve each problem according to specific requirements, and outputs the results to a text file. Each problem is uniquely identified and delineated in the input and output files, ensuring clear and organized data handling.

Features:
Input Parsing: The program reads from a single input file, structured to include problem numbers, input values, and delimiters to indicate the end of each problem's input.
Regex Solutions: Each problem is addressed using Java's robust regular expression capabilities, showcasing practical applications of regex in data validation, parsing, and transformation.
Output Formatting: The results are written to a single output file, following a structured format that mirrors the input file, ensuring easy correlation between input values and their corresponding outputs.
Extensibility: The modular design allows for easy addition of new problems and solutions, making the project a valuable learning and reference tool for anyone looking to enhance their skills with Java and regular expressions.
How to Use:
Prepare Input File: Create an input text file with the required format, starting with the problem number, followed by the input values, and ending with "end" for each problem.
Run the Program: Execute the Java application, which processes the input file and generates an output file with the solutions.
Review Output: The output file will contain the results for each problem, starting with the problem number and ending with "x" for each problem.
This project serves as an educational resource and a practical tool for solving common text processing challenges using regular expressions in Java.

Example Usage:
Email Validation: Validate email addresses from an input list.
Phone Number Formatting: Transform phone numbers into a standard format.
Data Extraction: Extract specific patterns from text data.
